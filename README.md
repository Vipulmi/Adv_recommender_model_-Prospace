This repo contains the code for the assignment of the ADVACNCED RECOMMENDER SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT offered by ProSpace under the file adv_recommender.ipynb.

In this code, I have demonstrated a simple recommender model based on the movie genre. Then, for more user based approach, I have shown 2 ways for recommendations. 

One is content based where the previous choices of the user govern which movies to recommend and the for the second one, I have used SVD model for collaboartive filtering, where the ratings of different users determine which movie to recommend. Key thing behind the 2nd approach is that it doesn't utilise the movie or its genre to predict which movie to recommend. It kind of groups the users based on their rating  history or interactions of similar user.
